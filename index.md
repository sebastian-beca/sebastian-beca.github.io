# About Green Magic Yoga
Green Magic Yoga is the name of a project my wife Javi and I started in 2018. We envisioned bringing together our interests in mindfulness, spirituality, yoga, ecopsychology, Cannabis and Psychedelics. For us Magic represents that which can help us re-connect to our True Nature. Many times this can involve learning to navigate expanded states of consciousness in a process of deep Self Discovery. Practices such as Meditation, Yoga, Fasting, Dance, Tranace and the safe, sacred and skilled use of plant medicines and psychedelic compounds can act as Magic and help us heal and find ineer peace.
We ran a yoga studio with this name in downtown Santa Cruz from 2021 to 2025 and currently still offer pop-up events and workshops around the SF Bay Area.
